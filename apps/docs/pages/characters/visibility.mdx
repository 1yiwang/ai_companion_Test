# ðŸ”“ Visibility

The Visibility setting determines who can see and interact your AI chatbot.

- **Public:** Choose this option if you want your character to be visible and interactive for everyone. It will be available for all users to discover and enjoy. **Each time other users interact with your character, you can earn crystals to spend on your public character.**
- **Private:** Choose this if you want to keep your character just to yourself. Only you can see or interact with it. It's like having a secret friend that only you know about.
