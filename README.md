# AI characters and roleplay for everyone

Open Roleplay serves is an open-source alternative to Character.ai.
You have full control over your data, model, and visual presentation.

Platforms like Character.ai and other AI agent platforms are fantastic. They sparked our interest in the potential of AI interactions. We utilize them for a variety of purposes, including productivity, entertainment, workflow automation, and more. However, these platforms often lack flexibility, transparency and customization options.

This is where Open Roleplay steps in. Whether self-hosted or hosted by us, it's ready to be deployed on your own domain with your personalized model and data.

## Features

- **Model Agnostic:** Choose from a variety of AI models, making it easy to interact with your favorite AI characters.
- **Highly Customizable:** Make your characters, personas and UI unique, for a one-of-a-kind roleplaying experience.
- **Roleplay-Focused:** Designed with roleplaying and storytelling in mind, it ensures an immersive and engaging experience.
- **Group Chat (Coming soon):** Invite your favorite characters to one chat room and chat together.
- **Extended Memory (Coming soon):** The character instructions and previous conversations are reminded to characters when the context window reaches its limit.
- **Image Generation (Coming soon):** Allow your character to generate their own selfies, drawings, and photos for a more immersive experience.
- **Voice (Coming soon):** Create characters that can talk to users with a realistic voice.
